Summary of user intent: refactor `submodules/vllm_service` so named serving profiles become the first-class product abstraction for HELM-audit local serving, while keeping the compose and KubeAI paths usable and adding an explicit export seam for machine-usable HELM bundles.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

I started by reading the existing catalogs, resolver, CLI, compose renderer, and KubeAI renderer before touching structure. The repo already had most of the ingredients: separate model and profile YAML catalogs, multiple backends, and HELM-oriented built-in profiles. The real problem is semantic drift. The code resolves a profile, but the resolved plan is still organized mostly around "services", model defaults, and incidental alias maps. That makes it harder to explain what the public identity is and harder to export a precise contract for helm_audit. My goal for this pass is to make the public serving-profile name intentional in the code, then keep the rest of the stack as a small compiler from that profile into backend-specific artifacts.

The main tradeoff I expect is between cleanliness and compatibility. A full rewrite into dataclasses or a brand-new manifest format would probably look tidy in isolation, but it would widen the change surface and make review harder. I’m choosing a modest refactor: keep YAML-driven catalogs and explicit Python dictionaries, add a normalization/schema layer for base models and serving profiles, and thread richer profile metadata through the resolver and exporters. That should make later documentation much easier while still preserving the narrow seam into helm_audit. The risk is that some older assumptions in templates or commands may still leak "service" terminology; I’ll try to preserve runtime compatibility while making the new naming story obvious in the resolved structures and new CLI paths.

Reusable design takeaways:
1. When a repo already has the right ingredients, prefer turning the intended abstraction into an explicit schema over inventing a new orchestration layer.
2. For reproducibility-sensitive work, transport shape and public identity belong in profile metadata, not as incidental router aliases.
3. Export seams are easiest to trust when generated artifacts are explicit, path handling is predictable, and machine-local values stay overridable instead of being baked into source templates.

Implementation outcome: I introduced a schema/normalization layer that separates base model metadata from serving-profile metadata, then pushed richer resolved profile identity into the plan, backend renderers, and a new HELM bundle exporter. I kept the compose and KubeAI backends intact, but made them consume explicit `serving_profile` and per-service identity fields rather than inferring everything from loose service names. I also added built-in audit-oriented named profiles for the active Qwen, GPT-OSS, Vicuna, and Pythia cases, plus compatibility handling for older `helm-*` names so the public CLI surface can emphasize the new names without hard-breaking prior references.

What surprised me: one unrelated legacy built-in profile referenced a missing model, and the first normalization pass caused that to poison every resolve attempt. That was a good reminder that catalog normalization should preserve inspectability rather than eagerly fail the entire repo. I changed the loader to keep invalid profiles marked as invalid and only fail when someone actually selects them. That feels like the right operational tradeoff here because it keeps the repo debuggable while still making profile-specific errors explicit.

Testing and confidence: I added focused tests for profile resolution, canonical-vs-legacy profile naming, KubeAI rendering, compose rendering, and HELM bundle export with a specific check that `gpt-oss-20b-chat` and `gpt-oss-20b-completions` export different client classes. I also ran a temp-workdir CLI sanity check for `verify-profile` and `export-helm-bundle`. I’m confident in the new named-profile flow and export seam. The main remaining risk is broader legacy-catalog cleanup: the built-in catalogs still contain older mixed/legacy profiles that were not fully redesigned in this pass, and they will deserve a later documentation and deprecation pass once the team agrees on the preferred public catalog surface.

Follow-up compatibility pass: this pass stayed narrow and corrected export contract mismatches rather than reworking the structure again. The big issue was that export behavior had drifted toward “backend implies client shape,” which produced the wrong result for KubeAI and also flattened away some useful audit-side distinctions. I changed the export path to use an explicit transport contract: GPT-OSS profiles now export the same LiteLLM/OpenAI-shaped `model_deployments.yaml` fields that the existing audit bundle expects; Qwen profiles can still export the direct-vLLM convention that the current audit-side Qwen bundle uses; and KubeAI-resolved profiles override those transport hints and always export OpenAI-compatible settings with `/openai/v1` and the public serving-profile name as the request model.

I also made the GPT-OSS migration alias more conservative. The old `helm-gpt-oss-20b` compatibility name now resolves to `gpt-oss-20b-completions`, not the chat variant, because the current audit runbook is effectively completions-first and explicitly treats chat as an opt-in secondary deployment. That change is less elegant than collapsing everything toward chat, but it matches the operational reality better and reduces surprise for existing users. I added exact-shape tests for the exported `model_deployments.yaml` files, plus checks for repo-relative versus machine-local `model_deployments_fpath` handling so the generated bundle examples align with the current `helm_audit` materialization seam instead of assuming a particular cwd.

Cross-repo ownership refactor: this follow-up moved the center of gravity back where it belongs. I added a benchmark-agnostic `describe-profile` surface in `vllm_service` that exports a generic serving-profile contract: profile identity, model identity, protocol/runtime details, backend-default access expectations, and optional additional access hints. The goal was to make the submodule explainable without mentioning CRFM HELM at all. Benchmark client classes, benchmark deployment naming, benchmark manifests, and machine-local bundle layout do not belong in the core serving-profile manager, so I did not add them to the generic contract. Instead, I left the benchmark bundle exporter in place only as a transitional compatibility path and made it print an explicit notice that the preferred owner is now the `helm_audit` integration layer.

The most delicate part was deciding what to do with the old `benchmark_transport` information. I did not want to blindly delete it, because some of those hints are still genuinely useful to external consumers. The compromise was to treat them as optional compatibility access hints rather than as the main contract. The generic contract now has a backend-default access surface plus optional additional accesses, which let the downstream benchmark adapter deliberately choose between routed OpenAI-compatible access and direct-vLLM access without forcing benchmark jargon into the core profile schema. That feels like a better long-term shape: serving profiles stay general, while integrations can still express sharp downstream choices.

I’m happier with the submodule after this change because its story is simpler: define named serving profiles, resolve them, render them, and describe them. The remaining benchmark exporter code is now clearly transitional debt rather than the repo’s identity. That is an acceptable temporary state because it preserves near-term operator usability while making the intended ownership boundary visible in both code and tests.

Summary of user intent: keep the current ownership boundary intact, but harden the seam by giving `helm_audit` one small public contract-loading API to call and by preserving only serving-side access/auth hints in the generic contract.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This was a good reminder that “generic contract” does not mean “leave every consumer to reconstruct setup details.” The first contract work already moved benchmark translation out of the submodule, but the audit adapter still had to know too much about how to load config, force builtin catalogs on, simulate hardware, and resolve a profile. That meant the public seam was conceptually right but mechanically too wide. I added `vllm_service.contracts.load_profile_contract(...)` as a thin canonical entrypoint that loads config from the repo root, enables the builtin catalogs, applies optional backend and hardware overrides, resolves the selected profile, and returns the benchmark-agnostic contract. The important part is not the amount of code; it is that the policy now lives in one obvious place inside the serving repo rather than being reconstructed elsewhere.

I also tightened the access metadata slightly by making auth expectations explicit with `auth_required`. That still feels like serving-side information to me, because it answers a generic question external consumers need to know: is this access surface expected to require a credential, and if so which env-var convention goes with it? What I explicitly did not move back in are benchmark-only concepts like HELM client classes, benchmark deployment naming, or manifest logic. The generic contract remains useful for any future consumer that wants to inspect how to talk to a resolved service without inheriting benchmark assumptions.

The main tradeoff here is that `load_profile_contract` now imports config/resolution internals inside the submodule’s public contracts layer. I’m comfortable with that because the direction of dependency is still correct: public API over internals within one repo is fine, while cross-repo integration over several internals was the real smell. The tests now cover the new loader directly for the active Qwen and GPT-OSS variants so future refactors in config or resolution have a better chance of preserving the external contract shape.

Design takeaways:
1. A public contract is easier to keep stable when the same module also owns the canonical way to construct it.
2. Auth expectations are part of an access surface; benchmark client mapping is not.
3. When a lower-level repo exports a machine-readable contract, the highest-value public API is often a single “load and resolve this profile for me” function rather than a larger façade.

Summary of user intent: do a narrow UX pass so a new user can follow the README and get either the Compose or KubeAI backend running without manually editing `config.yaml` or `models.yaml`, favoring one first-class setup command with flags and environment fallbacks.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This pass was mostly about making the CLI tell a more honest story. The repo had already outgrown the old “`init`, then edit YAML” posture, but the main branch UX still forced people back into it because the first real command that needed config would stop with “No config.yaml found.” The cleanest fix was not to make every command invent config on the fly, but to add a single `setup` command that writes or updates `config.yaml` from explicit flags or environment variables, then keep the common commands capable of taking a few important overrides without making users open files. That gives us one clear first-run habit while still keeping the config file as an inspectable artifact instead of hidden process state.

I chose to keep the override surface deliberately narrow and practical. `setup` accepts backend, active profile, compose command, ports, state/runtime paths, namespace, and ingress settings, with matching environment-variable fallbacks. Then `render`, `deploy`, `up`, `status`, `switch`, `smoke-test`, and the profile-inspection commands accept the most useful transient overrides such as backend, profile, namespace, ingress host, and compose command. The main tradeoff here is that not every config field became a flag, but that felt right for this stage of the repo. The goal was not to build a universal config editor; it was to make the common path copy/paste-safe and easy to explain later.

The subtle bug I had to guard against was stale renders under overrides. Once `deploy --backend kubeai --profile ...` becomes supported, a previously rendered Compose plan can look “fresh” even though it is for the wrong backend and profile. I fixed that by treating runtime overrides as a reason to re-render before `up` or `deploy`. That keeps the new override path trustworthy without changing the underlying plan/render structure. I also rewrote the README flows around `setup` and smaller chat-oriented examples for Compose so the built-in smoke test and direct curl commands align with the default request path instead of dropping users into a chat-vs-completions nuance immediately.

I’m confident in the new setup story because the added tests exercise it as a real CLI flow from an empty temp directory: `setup`, `render`, and backend-specific artifact generation, plus environment-variable fallback and transient backend/profile override behavior without persisting those overrides into the saved config. Remaining debt is mostly polish: `init` still exists as a compatibility command, and there are still many lower-signal config fields that are only file-driven. That is acceptable for now because the README no longer needs them for the happy path.

Design takeaways:
1. A copy/paste-safe setup flow is usually better served by one explicit config-writing command than by trying to make every command silently bootstrap state.
2. Allowing transient overrides is only safe if apply-style commands treat those overrides as invalidating prior renders.
3. README examples become much more trustworthy when they use profiles that naturally match the default smoke-test path instead of forcing special cases into the first-run experience.

Summary of user intent: do a small follow-up UX correctness pass by making `switch` persist only the active profile while keeping one-off overrides transient, and make the KubeAI README path more honest by using a safer first-run example plus cleanup of small setup-first inconsistencies.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This pass was narrower than the prior setup work, but it fixed the most important remaining surprise in the new UX. The first setup-first design deliberately allowed transient overrides on common commands, but `switch` was still saving the fully override-expanded runtime config back to disk. That blurred the boundary between “use this override right now” and “persist this setting for future commands,” which is exactly the kind of silent mutation that makes operators distrust a CLI. I changed `switch` so it now loads the saved config, updates only `active_profile`, writes that back, and only then applies runtime overrides in-memory for the immediate build/render/apply step. That keeps `setup` as the general config-writing command and `switch` as the profile-switching command.

The interesting tradeoff was not technical difficulty, but deciding how much behavior to encode into tests. I chose one focused unit-style test around `cmd_switch` rather than more subprocess integration because the point here is semantic correctness: the saved file should keep its original backend, compose command, and namespace, while the invocation can still temporarily render/deploy with an override backend and namespace. That test gives us much better protection against accidental future regressions than another end-to-end happy path would have.

For the README, I took the safer option and changed the KubeAI getting-started flow to a smaller built-in profile, `qwen2-5-7b-instruct-turbo-default`, instead of the much heavier 72B example. That makes the first-run story more honest without turning the KubeAI section into a hardware tutorial. I also aligned a couple of small drifts introduced by the previous pass: the top-level example now shows `setup ...` followed by `render` instead of `render --profile`, the top-level `describe-profile` example uses the same smaller default profile, and the missing-config guidance points to the same Compose-first profile the README uses. That keeps the onboarding story consistent from error messages through the main command list and backend sections.

Design takeaways:
1. A command that persists state should save only the state it conceptually owns, even if it accepts extra runtime overrides for convenience.
2. When a README happy path is hardware-sensitive, a smaller built-in example is often better than a disclaimer about the larger one.
3. Small message drift matters in setup-oriented tools because users notice inconsistency before they understand the underlying model.

Summary of user intent: do a focused KubeAI bugfix pass so local validation/render/deploy use the same resource-profile source as the Helm install flow, without requiring users to duplicate resource profiles manually in `config.yaml`.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This pass clarified a mismatch that had been hiding in plain sight: the repo was conceptually treating KubeAI Helm values as the thing we install, but still validating against `config.yaml.resource_profiles` unless that section happened to be present. The cleanest small fix was to introduce an explicit canonical local file, `generated/kubeai/kubeai-values.yaml`, and make the KubeAI path prefer that file as the resource-profile source of truth whenever it exists. I added a `kubeai-sync-resource-profiles --from-file ...` command, plus a `setup --resource-profiles-file ...` convenience hook, so the user can generate or handwrite one values file and then sync it into the repo-local location that `validate`, `render`, and the Helm install step all agree on.

I intentionally kept a compatibility fallback to `config.yaml.resource_profiles` when no synced KubeAI values file exists. The tests made it obvious that making the synced file mandatory would have turned this into a larger behavior change than the prompt asked for. The resulting model is: synced KubeAI values file first, config fallback second. That still solves the real bug because the new local file now overrides the stale or missing config case, which was the operational pain point. It also keeps the current setup/render path from breaking for users who have not yet adopted the sync step.

The other important detail was invalidation. Because `generated/kubeai/kubeai-values.yaml` is both the synced local source and the rendered Helm values artifact, syncing new resource profiles must invalidate any old plan so `deploy` cannot quietly reuse stale KubeAI artifacts. I handled that by removing `generated/plan.yaml` in the sync path. On the usability side, I tightened namespace messaging in `status` and `deploy` so a namespace mismatch now points users back to the configured `setup --backend kubeai --namespace ...` value instead of surfacing only raw command failure text.

The README changes stay focused on this plumbing fix. I replaced the old “HACK” section with the actual built-in profile names the repo expects, routed the generated file through `python manage.py kubeai-sync-resource-profiles --from-file values-kubeai-local-gpu.yaml`, updated the Helm install example to use `generated/kubeai/kubeai-values.yaml`, and added the preflight `helm list -n kubeai` / `kubectl -n kubeai get pods` check before the KubeAI backend flow. That makes the docs match the code path again, which is the real win here.

Design takeaways:
1. A local generated artifact can safely be the source of truth if there is an explicit sync step and render invalidates stale plans after that sync.
2. Compatibility fallbacks are worth keeping when they preserve an existing happy path without weakening the new preferred source of truth.
3. Namespace-sensitive Kubernetes errors are much more actionable when the CLI points back to the exact namespace-setting command users actually ran.

Summary of user intent: revise the KubeAI resource-profile patch so the synced canonical input is no longer the same path as the generated render output, while preserving the original bugfix intent and keeping config fallback behavior intact unless the user explicitly adopts the sync flow.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This revision fixed the design seam the prior patch had introduced. Treating `generated/kubeai/kubeai-values.yaml` as both durable input and render output made `render` a hidden state transition, which is exactly the opposite of what a generated directory should mean. The new model is cleaner: `kubeai-values.local.yaml` is the explicit synced local input file, and `generated/kubeai/kubeai-values.yaml` is the rendered output artifact copied from the chosen input source for the current plan. That means a normal render no longer changes future source selection, and the old `config.yaml.resource_profiles` fallback keeps working until the user explicitly adopts the sync flow.

The important compatibility nuance was to preserve fallback semantics after render, not just before it. I changed KubeAI resolution so it prefers the synced local file only when that file exists; otherwise it continues using `config.yaml.resource_profiles`. Because the rendered artifact is now always derived from `deployment["resource_profiles_values"]`, changing config and re-rendering still updates the generated Helm values file when no synced local file has been adopted. Once a synced file exists, it wins intentionally, and that win is now explicit and inspectable rather than an accidental side effect of having rendered once in the past.

I also tightened the non-lossy requirement by preserving raw `resourceProfiles` entries from the synced values document instead of normalizing them down to only the currently understood fields. Validation still only cares about profile names, but rendering now writes the synced values document back out verbatim enough to keep extra supported or unknown keys like `extraField` intact. That felt like the right compromise: preserve structure when the user intentionally synced a Helm values file, but keep the internal config fallback simpler for the legacy path.

Design takeaways:
1. Generated output should be derivable from canonical state, not reused as canonical state itself.
2. A compatibility fallback is only real if normal output generation cannot silently disable it.
3. When syncing user-supplied Helm values, preserving unknown keys is often safer than inventing a lossy normalization layer.

## 2026-04-19 00:07:41 +0000

Summary of user intent: apply the smallest clean fix for the remaining KubeAI regression by making `deploy`/staleness detection notice changes to `kubeai-values.local.yaml`, while preserving the new source-of-truth split and the config fallback behavior.

Model and configuration: Codex (GPT-5-based coding agent), default in-session configuration.

This was a narrow but important follow-up. Once `kubeai-values.local.yaml` became the explicit canonical synced source, it also became a real input to the rendered plan, which means staleness detection had to treat it the same way it already treats `config.yaml`. Without that, `deploy` could keep reusing an older rendered plan after the canonical local file changed, which would undercut the whole point of having a synced source in the first place. The fix was intentionally small: when the backend is `kubeai`, `render_is_stale()` now compares the modification time of `kubeai-values.local.yaml` against the current rendered outputs and forces a rerender if the local file is newer.

The tests here matter more than the code size. I added one direct stale-check test and one deploy-rerender test because they pin two different promises: first, that the CLI recognizes the canonical local file as an input to render freshness, and second, that `deploy` actually consumes the updated canonical file rather than merely reporting “stale” in theory. I kept the existing config-fallback test in place so the repo still proves the legacy path is unaffected when no synced local file exists.

Design takeaways:
1. Once a file becomes canonical input, stale detection must treat it as input everywhere apply-style commands rely on freshness checks.
2. A clean source-of-truth split is only complete when freshness logic follows the same split.
3. Focused tests around stale detection are worth adding because timestamp-based bugs are easy to reintroduce during unrelated CLI cleanup.
